## Introduction

In this project, naive bayes model, support vector machine and neural network are implemented for recognizing the DNA binding sites on protein sequence. Through leave one out cross validation and t-test, it is indicated that support vector machine has the best performance, while the performance of the naive bayes model is the worst

## Dataset:

### Data Collection

The list of the proteins were obtained from the [article](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/24/7189).
All the pdb file and the interaction file were downloaded from [NPIDB](http://npidb.belozersky.msu.ru/).

### Data Preprocess

#### Generate the residue sequence of the protein from the pdb file



#### Generate the label sequence of the protein from the pdb file and the interactive file

## Techniques

### Naive Bayes model ([Reference](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi1oKLloYjMAhUKqh4KHYnuBkIQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Flib.dr.iastate.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D2782%26context%3Drtd&usg=AFQjCNHYze8sldjzQdtA5dhBao2qu1bSqA&sig2=H_Zji6sEkTpw8R-QCOPmGw&bvm=bv.119028448,d.dmo))
